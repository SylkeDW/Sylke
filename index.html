<p>Hi, I'm Sylke De Wilde, a soon to be functional analyst. Welcome to my website!</p>

  <h1>Let's get personnal</h1>
  <p>Currently 37 years old and living in Antwerp, with my husband and baby twins.
  We live on a cozy apartment on the ninth floor with a beautiful view of the city
  and within walking distance of several nice spots.
  With two babies, my life is right now mainly made up of diapers and bottle-feeding.
  But in the spare time I still have, I love to wine and dine, watch a good movie or series around and
  do some browsing on the internet for things I wanna have (but don't need).
  I have a love for interior design and graphic design. I did an online course for graphic designer,
  so I like to play around with Illustrator. </p>

  <h1>Work, work, work</h1>
  <p>After high school, I did a bachelor's degree in medical laboratory.
  I started working as lab technician in a clinical lab of a hospital
  but after a few years I wanted a job with some more responsibilities.
  I transferred in the same hospital to the pathalogical lab, where I started as main lab technician
  combined with the position of quality analyst.
  In 2018, after a fusion with another lab, I only did the job of quality analyst.
  I liked doing my job, but after all these years of working at a lab,
  I started looking forward to a different type of job. Hence this switch to functional analyst.
 </p>

 <h1>Some useless facts about me</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I don't like the opening credit of series.
    But I mostly watch Neflix and Amazon Prime, where I can happily skip the credits.</li>
  <li>At the moment, working out is doing ringfit on the switch.
    I can do this at home whenever I want, just perfect.</li>
  <li>I hate coffee, give me some tea or a chai latte instead and I'm happy.
    Another thing about my tea drinking, I drink my black tea always with milk.
    For some people sounds this disgusting, but for me it is just divine. </li>
</ul>
